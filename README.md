# Rummikub

A headless Rummikub engine written in Elm.

`RummikubEngine.Main.newGame` and `RummikubEngine.Main.attemptMove` together represent the main interface to the engine.

## Development
Note: installation failed for me on node v14, I had to use node v12.

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app). To install Create Elm App: `npm install -g create-elm-app`.

The interesting parts of this project are only illuminated by the tests, which you can run with `elm-app test`.

There is a start to a head here, which you can see with `elm-app start`.
